                <h3>Monday, 20th April 202 - The Odin Project</h3>
                <p>So tonight has been a research night on where I am best suited to learning
                    web developement and I have decided to use The Odin Project. Their project based
                    learning and acess to immense amount of source material appeals to my style of
                    learning. I have been learning the basics of using git tonight and created my first git
                    file with this website. Apparently learning JavaScript is on slight hold whilst I get into this
                    learning pathway that TOP have provided. Not complaining as these steps are still
                    confusing as heck to me regardless, so worthwhile to learn. So I shall march foward, but as long as I stick to
                    TOP, I'm happy with my direction as a front end (and possibly even full stack) web
                    developer. It's an exciting time, but I am mentally preparing myself for the head
                    smashing as I aproach harder stuff that takes me more outside my comfort zone and
                    makes me actually problem solve. Until tomorrow, farewell.

                <h3>Sunday, 19th April 2020 - CSS Basics</h3>
                <p>As of 20 minutes ago I finished Codecademy's CSS course and am feeling pretty good
                    in regards to setting up the design of this blog. As much as I see JavaScript as the
                    "mammoth" of the learning journey. I was impressed with the variety and depth of CSS.
                    There is a lot that is relatively easily manipulated within the CSS properties and a whole
                    lot of values to play around with. As much as I just want to charge straight into JavaScript
                    right now, I think I'll spend the rest of the night (it's 9:45) making this webface
                    presentable to anyone who will eventually read this jumble of thoughts. So for now, I'll
                    sign off and do a later edit showing off my progress.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Edit: 2 hours later and I've worked out that I'll never be a graphical designer. For now, I've
                    got the website looking like <a href="./April-2020-Photos/19.4.2020-sunday.jpg">this</a>, and
                    I'll make it prettier at a later date. But for now, sleep, and JavaScript basics tomorrow.

                <h3>Saturday, 18th April 2020 - The Journey Begins</h3>
                <p> Today marks the start of my aspirations to get a job is software development through the
                    path of a front end web dev. Currently writing this as I build up the rest of this blog. For
                    the last 3 weeks I have been doing various things with programming. I did the first few weeks
                    of the cs50 course online, got frustrated because it was hard and starting learning the basics of
                    python. Corey Schafer is amazing and his tutorials were clear and concise, but then I finished
                    his first 9 tutorials and realised that the things that are specialised for python don't interest me
                    all that much. So after doing a few turtorials and not enjoying it, I watched more youtube and
                    came across <strong>Code Drip</strong>'s video "<em>The FASTEST way to become a software
                    engineer</em>". I highly recommend anyone who is looking to change careers into coding or just
                    start coding in general to check him out. I'm following the advice of that video and going
                    down this learning path. First learn HTML and CSS, then learning the basics of vanilla
                    JavaScipt, get proficiency in Javascript, before learning to use React.js and Node.js. I still do
                    not comprehend or understand a lot of the aspects of coding and wev development, but I'm
                    enjoying the process. I finished the HTML course on code academy and about half way
                    through the CSS course. I'm writing this in Atom, saving it and uploading to a local file on the
                    internet. Hopefully I can learn JavaScript somewhat quickly so I can get this uploaded onto a
                    public domain. For now I'm off to learn more CSS and make this blog presentable (as my page
                    currently looks like <a href="./April-2020-Photos/18.4.2020-Saturday.jpg">this.</a>)
