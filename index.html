                <h3>Thursday, 30th April 2020 - JavaScipt Fundamentals</h3>
                <p>Only an hour block today, feeling pretty tired, but its nice to have this morning routine
                    which should keep me on track. Might start doing some code wars later today to keep me
                    working on my fundamentals to compliment my learning on TOP. Otherwise I think
                    I'll have a relaxing day.

                <h3>Wednesday 29th April 2020 - The New Regime</h3>
                <p> 06:30 - Wake up, shower, fuel the brain with coffee. <br>
                    07:00 - Start 1 hour coding block. <br>
                    08:00 - 10 minute break. <br>
                    08:10 - Start 1 hour coding block. <br>
                    09:10 - 10 minute break. <br>
                    09:20 - Start 1 hour coding block. <br>
                    10:20 - Rest of day goes as follows:<br>
                    &nbsp for (fatigue = arbitrary; fatigue < brainpower; fatigue++) {<br>
                        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Start another hour of coding; <br>
                    &nbsp }<br>
                        Otherwise, rest. You deserve it<br>
                                  <br>
                    This is the current plan for my coding going forward. It takes inspiration
                    <strong>Code Drip</strong>'s video "<em>How I stayed focused while learning to code</em>"
                    in which he suggests to code in the morning and to play around with your morning schedule.
                    The second inspiration was the reddit post <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/g98sn4/spent_the_last_100_days_learning_to_code_and_told/">
                    "Spent the last 100 days learning to code, and told no one."</a> which was extremely
                    inspirational and sets out an awesome framework for what can be done. I'm following
                    his 3 hours a day of 1 hour blocks, as well as using forest app on my phone stop any
                    distractions whilst coding.

                <h3>Tuesday 28th April 2020 - Back from "holidays" </h3>
                <p>Have spent the last 4 days playing minecraft and watching videos about coding on
                    youtube instead of actually coding. It has been a super productive few days.
                    However, this evening I finally sat down and started on the fundamentals of JavaScipt
                    in the Odin Project. Doing the CS50 Introduction to Computer Science course (or at
                    least the first 3 weeks of it) has massively helped with my understanding of coding
                    basics of variables, loops, fuctions etc. So I am making my way through the JavaScript
                    fundamentals pretty quickly. Plan is to start organising a specific time of day to do
                    coding so I don't just go "I'll do it some time today," or "I'll do it when I go to bed" and
                    then end up either too tired, or too unfocused to actually do it. Tomorrow shall be the
                    start of this new regime.

                <h3>Thursday, 23rd April 2020 - Learning Dev Tools</h3>
                <p>Spent about 30-60 minutes learning how to use the "inspect" dev tool in Chrome,
                    but then lost focus as I was asked to apply it with a little HTML/CSS project.
                    I think I'll move onto JavaScript tomorrow to keep me motivated and on track, but will
                    definitely come back to it at a later date.

                <h3>Tuesday, 22nd April 2020 - My Normal Life</h3>
                <p>Spent the day with my girlfriend, so no coding got done today.</p>
            </div>
            <div class=blog_post>
                <h3>Tuesday, 21st April 2020 - Reset CSS </h3>
                <p>It is currently 12:30am on Wednesday morning and since 9pm when I got to my room,
                    I have spent about 2.5 hours on youtube and less than 1 working on The Odin Project. On the
                    bright side, in that short time I set up a depository on github for this website and it is
                    now acessible and saved there which gives a good feeling. Then after that I kept going
                    with TOP and learned about using a reset CSS file to make this website look the same
                    on all browsers, which is spectacularly important, however now my website looks like
                    <a href="./April-2020-Photos/22.4.2020-wednesday.jpg">this</a>. Which just means I'll
                    have to changing the box sizes is the css sheets, as it's no longer just the automatic google
                    chrome ones. Next up on TOP is learning web developer tools which I think I'll do
                    tomorrow and then <em>Thursday</em> I can finally starting learning the basics of
                    Javascript.

                <h3>Monday, 20th April 2020 - The Odin Project</h3>
                <p>So tonight has been a research night on where I am best suited to learning
                    web developement and I have decided to use The Odin Project. Their project based
                    learning and acess to immense amount of source material appeals to my style of
                    learning. I have been learning the basics of using git tonight and created my first git
                    file with this website. Apparently learning JavaScript is on slight hold whilst I get into this
                    learning pathway that TOP have provided. Not complaining as these steps are still
                    confusing as heck to me regardless, so worthwhile to learn. So I shall march foward, but as long as I stick to
                    TOP, I'm happy with my direction as a front end (and possibly even full stack) web
                    developer. It's an exciting time, but for now, I am mentally preparing myself for the head
                    smashing as I aproach harder stuff that is to come. The things that will take me more
                    outside my comfort zone and makes me problem solve without the handholding.

                <h3>Sunday, 19th April 2020 - CSS Basics</h3>
                <p>As of 20 minutes ago I finished Codecademy's CSS course and am feeling pretty good
                    in regards to setting up the design of this blog. As much as I see JavaScript as the
                    "mammoth" of the learning journey. I was impressed with the variety and depth of CSS.
                    There is a lot that is relatively easily manipulated within the CSS properties and a whole
                    lot of values to play around with. As much as I just want to charge straight into JavaScript
                    right now, I think I'll spend the rest of the night (it's 9:45) making this webface
                    presentable to anyone who will eventually read this jumble of thoughts. So for now, I'll
                    sign off and do a later edit showing off my progress.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Edit: 2 hours later and I've worked out that I'll never be a graphical designer. For now, I've
                    got the website looking like <a href="./April-2020-Photos/19.4.2020-sunday.jpg">this</a>, and
                    I'll make it prettier at a later date. But for now, sleep, and JavaScript basics tomorrow.

                <h3>Saturday, 18th April 2020 - The Journey Begins</h3>
                <p> Today marks the start of my aspirations to get a job is software development through the
                    path of a front end web dev. Currently writing this as I build up the rest of this blog. For
                    the last 3 weeks I have been doing various things with programming. I did the first few weeks
                    of the cs50 course online, got frustrated because it was hard and starting learning the basics of
                    python. Corey Schafer is amazing and his tutorials were clear and concise, but then I finished
                    his first 9 tutorials and realised that the things that are specialised for python don't interest me
                    all that much. So after doing a few turtorials and not enjoying it, I watched more youtube and
                    came across <strong>Code Drip</strong>'s video "<em>The FASTEST way to become a software
                    engineer</em>". I highly recommend anyone who is looking to change careers into coding or just
                    start coding in general to check him out. I'm following the advice of that video and going
                    down this learning path. First learn HTML and CSS, then learning the basics of vanilla
                    JavaScipt, get proficiency in Javascript, before learning to use React.js and Node.js. I still do
                    not comprehend or understand a lot of the aspects of coding and wev development, but I'm
                    enjoying the process. I finished the HTML course on code academy and about half way
                    through the CSS course. I'm writing this in Atom, saving it and uploading to a local file on the
                    internet. Hopefully I can learn JavaScript somewhat quickly so I can get this uploaded onto a
                    public domain. For now I'm off to learn more CSS and make this blog presentable (as my page
                    currently looks like <a href="./April-2020-Photos/18.4.2020-Saturday.jpg">this.</a>)
